      Silicon Valley is the byproduct of unfettered tech-urbanism: skyrocketing
      gentrification, increasing homelessness, surveillance and income
      inequality. When Amazon comes to Friedrichshain, the existing precarious
      situation is intensified. We want to stop that!

      Construction for Berlin's tallest building is scheduled to be completed in
      2023. Plans are for 3400 software developers to occupy 28 of the 35
      stories. It will be located on the *Warschauer Bridge*, next to the East
      Side Mall, a relic of the Media Spree era. Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg will
      be transformed into a hotspot for tech giants. The mantra of *it brings
      jobs* is repeated. Of course those jobs are not intended for local
      residents. The neighborhood will see a demographic shift, with tech firms
      *disrupting* the neighborhood staples: small businesses, schools,
      community initiatives and cultural centers. In Silicon Valley, the
      consequences of *laissez faire* capitalism is apparent. The recent
      victories in New York City and Kreuzberg show that we are not simply at
      the mercy of real estate, but that we can successfully push back against
      tech giants through grassroots coalitions. This is exactly what we aim
      for. Together we creatively and loudly protest against the Amazon
      infestation in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. A conglomerate like Amazon, which
      harasses employees, pays no taxes while earning hundreds of billions, and
      propagates digital surveillance, has no business in Berlin or anywhere!
      The city belongs to us!
